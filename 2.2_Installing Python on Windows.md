# 2.2 Installing Python on Windows


### Using the Python Installer Method:

1. **Download the Installer**  
   Go to [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and click the download button for the latest version of Python. The site will automatically detect your operating system.

2. **Run the Installer**  
   Locate the downloaded installer (it should be in your Downloads folder) and double-click it to run.

3. **Customize Installation Options (Optional)**  
   - **Check the box** that says "Add Python to PATH" at the bottom of the installation window. This step is important to allow you to run Python from the command line.
   - Click "Customize installation" if you want to adjust settings like installation location or add additional features.
   - If you're fine with the defaults, click "Install Now."

4. **Complete the Installation**  
   After the installer finishes, you’ll see a setup success message.

5. **Verify the Installation**  
   Open the Command Prompt (type `cmd` in the search bar) and check if Python is installed correctly by typing:
   ```cmd
   python --version
   ```

6. **Verify `pip` Installation**  
   Check if `pip` is installed by running:
   ```cmd
   pip --version
   ```

### Using Windows Package Manager (winget):

To install Python using the Windows Package Manager (`winget`), follow these steps:

1. **Open Command Prompt or PowerShell**  
   - Press `Win + S`, type "cmd" or "PowerShell", and select it to open.
   - Ensure that you are running as an administrator to avoid permission issues.

2. **Search for Available Python Versions (Optional)**  
   To see which Python versions are available via `winget`, you can search for Python packages:
   ```cmd
   winget search Python
   ```

3. **Install Python**  
   Install the latest version of Python by running:
   ```cmd
   winget install Python.Python.3
   ```
   This command will automatically download and install the latest stable version of Python available via `winget`.

4. **Add Python to PATH (If Not Automatically Added)**  
   - Sometimes, `winget` installation automatically adds Python to PATH, but if it doesn’t, you can add it manually:
     - Go to **Settings > System > About > Advanced System Settings**.
     - In the **System Properties** window, click on **Environment Variables**.
     - Under **System Variables**, find and select `Path`, then click **Edit**.
     - Click **New** and add the path to the Python installation, typically `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\`.

5. **Verify the Installation**  
   After installation, check that Python was installed successfully by running:
   ```cmd
   python --version
   ```

6. **Verify `pip` Installation**  
   Ensure that `pip` (Python's package manager) was installed correctly by running:
   ```cmd
   pip --version
   ```

**Note:** After completing these steps, Python should be installed and ready to use on your Windows system via `winget`.
