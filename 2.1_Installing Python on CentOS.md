# Installing Python on Linux (CentOS/Fedora)

To install Python on an RPM-based Linux distribution like CentOS or Fedora, follow these steps:

1. **Update the Package List**  
   Start by updating your package list:
   ```bash
   sudo yum update -y
   ```

2. **Install Python**  
   Use the following command to install Python 3. On CentOS 8 and Fedora, Python 3 is available in the default repositories:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install -y python3
   ```

3. **Verify the Installation**  
   After installation, verify that Python is installed and check its version:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

4. **Install `pip` (Python Package Manager)**  
   To manage Python packages, install `pip` with:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install -y python3-pip
   ```

5. **Verify `pip` Installation**  
   Check if `pip` is installed correctly by checking its version:
   ```bash
   pip3 --version
   ```
