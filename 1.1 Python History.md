## 1.1 Python History

---

### Overview of Python’s creation and evolution.
---

### 1. **Python's Inception (Late 1980s - Early 1990s)**

   - **Creator**: Python was created by **Guido van Rossum**, a Dutch programmer. He began working on Python in the late 1980s while at the **Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)** in the Netherlands.
   - **Objective**: Guido wanted to build a new language that was more readable and easy to use than existing programming languages at the time. He intended it to be as powerful as **C** or **Java** but much easier for beginners to learn.
   - **Inspiration**: The language was heavily inspired by the **ABC language**, which Guido had worked on at CWI. ABC was known for its simplicity and readability, but it was somewhat limited. Python retained ABC’s simplicity but added more advanced capabilities, especially in handling exceptions and extending the language's capabilities.
   - **Naming**: Guido named Python not after the snake but after the British comedy show **"Monty Python’s Flying Circus."** He wanted Python to reflect the sense of fun and playfulness that characterized the show.

### 2. **Early Python Releases (Python 1.0 in 1991)**

   - **Python 1.0**: Released in **February 1991**, Python 1.0 introduced key features like:
     - **Functions** and **modules** for code organization and reusability.
     - **Exception handling**, a way to manage errors in a clean, organized manner.
     - **Dynamic typing**, where variable types are determined at runtime rather than being explicitly defined.
     - **High-level data structures** (e.g., lists and dictionaries), which made it easier to manage complex data.

   - **Community Support**: From the start, Python emphasized community contributions. Python’s first official community discussion platform, the **comp.lang.python** newsgroup, launched in the early 1990s, and the community quickly grew.

---

### 3. **Python 2.x Series (2000 - 2010)**

   - **Python 2.0**: Released in **October 2000**, this major version introduced several significant features:
