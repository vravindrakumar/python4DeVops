# Installing Python on Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

To install Python on a Debian-based Linux distribution like Debian or Ubuntu, follow these steps:

1. **Update the Package List**  
   Before installing any new software, itâ€™s best to update the package list:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Install Python**  
   Use the following command to install the latest version of Python available in the repositories:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3
   ```

3. **Verify the Installation**  
   After installation, verify that Python is installed and check its version:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

4. **Install `pip` (Python Package Manager)**  
   If you need `pip` to install additional Python packages, install it with:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3-pip
   ```

5. **Verify `pip` Installation**  
   Confirm that `pip` is installed correctly by checking its version:
   ```bash
   pip3 --version
   ```
